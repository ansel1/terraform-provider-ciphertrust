# Using terraform-provider-ciphertrust

Copy the terraform-provider-ciphertrust binary to the terraform plugin directory:

    ~/.terraform.d/plugins/thales.com/terraform/ciphertrust/1.0.0/linux_amd64/

To connect to AWS the following environment variables are required:

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

To connect to Azure the following environment variables are required:

    export ARM_CLIENT_ID
    export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
    export ARM_TENANT_ID
    export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

# Provider Configuration

CipherTrust provider configuration can be configured in the terraform script. For example:

    provider "ciphertrust" {
      address			= "https://34.207.194.87"
      username			= "bob"
      password			= "password"
      domain			= "root"
      log_file			= "ctp.log"
      log_level			= debug
      no_ssl_verify		= false
      rest_api_timeout	= 240
      azure_opeation_timeout = 240
      hsm_operation_timeout = 60
    }

Only address, username, password are required, the others have default values as per the above example.

All provider configuration can be set in a configuration file in ~/.ciphertrust/config.

    For example,
          address = https://34.207.194.87
          username = bob
          password = password

    If the above are specified in the configuration file the provider can be initialized as:

        provider "ciphertrust" {)

Settings in the provider block of a terraform script take precedence over tose in the configuration file.

# Provider Logging

By default logs will be written to ctp.log at the "info" level.

The log file and log level can be set in the provider configuration block.

Available log levels are debug, info, warning, error, off.

For example:
    provider "ciphertrust" {
        log_file  = "azkeys.log"
        log_level = "debug"
    }
