# ciphertrust_dsm_key (Resource)

DSM keys can be created for uploading to a cloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ciphertrust_dsm_connection" "connection" {
  name        = "dsm_connection_name"
  nodes {
    hostname    = "10.12.345.67"
    certificate = "dsm-server.pem"
  }
  password = "dsm_password"
  username = "dsm_username"
}

resource "ciphertrust_dsm_domain" "dsm_domain" {
  dsm_connection = ciphertrust_dsm_connection.connection.id
  domain_id      = 4321
}

resource "ciphertrust_dsm_key" "dsm_key" {
  name            = "dsm_key_name"
  algorithm       = "AES256"
  domain          = ciphertrust_dsm_domain.dsm_domain.id
  encryption_mode = "CBC"
  extractable     = true
  object_type     = "symmetric"
}
```
